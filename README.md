# BehaviourTree_Test
In this Unity project, a day in the life of a fisherman is recreated by an NPC, which is controlled by a data structure called a behavior tree.

The behaviour tree instance controlling this NPC has a structure like the diagram below.

This second diagram below is a more accurate representation of the behavior tree instance, and is a direct reproduction of the program. The purple triangle means that there is a waiting period, and after a certain waiting period, a success or failure decision is made with a certain probability.
